This is an IBus engine for users of the Cangjie and Quick input methods.

It is primarily intended to Hong Kong people who want to input Traditional
Chinese, as they are (by far) the majority of Cangjie and Quick users.

However, it should work for others as well (e.g to input Simplified Chinese).

Note that the actual input logic is handled by libcangjie:

Getting the source code
=======================

The Git sources are available at the following address:
    https://github.com/bochecha/ibus-cangjie

Installing
==========

This is pretty much a standard Autotools project. You can install it with the
usual sequence::

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    # make install

Of course, if you got the sources from Git, you will need to run the
``autogen.sh`` script first.

The engine and its setup UI should work with Python 2 or 3. The default is
Python 2, and you can build with Python 3 instead by passing the appropraite
option to the ``configure`` script::

    $ configure --enable-python3
