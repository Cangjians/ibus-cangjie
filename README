This is an IBus engine for users of the Cangjie and Quick input methods.

It is primarily intended to Hong Kong people who want to input Traditional
Chinese, as they are (by far) the majority of Cangjie and Quick users.

However, it should work for others as well (e.g to input Simplified Chinese).

Note that the actual input logic is handled by libcangjie:

Getting the source code
=======================

The Git sources are available at the following address:
    https://github.com/bochecha/ibus-cangjie

Installing
==========

This is pretty much a standard Autotools project. You can install it with the
usual sequence::

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    # make install

Of course, if you got the sources from Git, you will need to run the
``autogen.sh`` script first.

Dependencies
============

To use this engine, you will need the following:

  - Python >= 3.2
      -> http://python.org

  - ibus >= 1.4.1
      Note that the GObject-Introspection bindings must be enabled
      -> https://code.google.com/p/ibus/

  - pycangjie
      -> https://github.com/bochecha/pycangjie

  - the Python 3 GObject bindings
      -> https://live.gnome.org/PyGObject

  - pycanberra (optional)
      This is needed to play event sounds, especially to give feedback to the
      user on incorrect inputs.
      -> https://github.com/psykoyiko/pycanberra

      Note that we require a Python 3 version of pycanberra, as can be found
      in this (yet-unmerged) pull request:
      -> https://github.com/psykoyiko/pycanberra/pull/2

      IBus Cangjie will fail gracefully if pycanberra is not available though,
      and just won't play any sound.
