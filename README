This is an IBus engine for users of the Cangjie and Quick input methods.

It is primarily intended to Hong Kong people who want to input Traditional
Chinese, as they are (by far) the majority of Cangjie and Quick users.

However, it should work for others as well (e.g to input Simplified Chinese).

Note that the actual input logic is handled by libcangjie:

Getting the source code
=======================

The Git sources are available at the following address:
    https://github.com/bochecha/ibus-cangjie

Installing
==========

This is pretty much a standard Autotools project. You can install it with the
usual sequence::

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    # make install

Of course, if you got the sources from Git, you will need to run the
``autogen.sh`` script first.

Dependencies
============

To use this engine, you will need the following:

  - Python >= 3.2
      -> http://python.org

  - ibus >= 1.4.1
      Note that the GObject-Introspection bindings must be enabled
      -> https://code.google.com/p/ibus/

  - pycangjie
      -> https://github.com/bochecha/pycangjie

  - pycanberra
      Not needed currently as we bundle it. More details at the end of this
      document.
      -> https://github.com/psykoyiko/pycanberra

  - the Python 3 GObject bindings
      -> https://live.gnome.org/PyGObject

pycanberra
==========

ibus-cangjie requires pycanberra to play event sounds.

However, pycanberra hasn't been ported to Python 3 yet:
    https://github.com/psykoyiko/pycanberra/pull/2

To avoid being blocked, we are currently bundling it in ibus-cangjie.

It is a temporary solution, though, which should be resolved as soon as
possible.

pycanberra is under the LGPL license, you can get it from there:
