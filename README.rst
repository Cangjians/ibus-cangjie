This is an IBus engine for users of the Cangjie and Quick input methods.

It is primarily intended to Hong Kong people who want to input Traditional
Chinese, as they are (by far) the majority of Cangjie and Quick users.

However, it should work for others as well (e.g to input Simplified Chinese).

Note that the actual input logic is handled by libcangjie2:
    https://github.com/Cangjians/libcangjie2/

Development happens `on github`_, and stable release tarballs will be
available when we reach that point.

Installation instructions can be found in the ``INSTALL.rst`` file.
