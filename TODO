- Wrap Wan Leung's libcangjie when it's ready
- Actually implement the engine functionality:
  - 9 candidates per page
  - no navigation with arrow keys (it's slow compared to numbers, so nobody
    uses it, and some keyboards don't even have them without the `fn` key)
  - pgup to switch to previous page of candidates
  - pgdwn **and space** to switch to next page
  - cycle through pages
- Setup the necessary stuff for i18n
- Get an icon for the setup UI
- Modify the GNOME Control Center whitelist so it uses `cangjie` and `quick`
  instead of the current `cangjie3`, `cangjie5`,... from ibus-tables
- Drop the obsolete DBs from ibus-table-chinese
