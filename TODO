Critical for 1.0
================

Figure out what's the deal with IBus in /usr/local
--------------------------------------------------

I haven't been able to get IBus to find engines in /usr/local, but I might
just have overlooked the fact that I had to restart IBus after installing
ibus-cangjie...

Try again, ask the IBus devs.

If it works, great. If it doesn't, make sure that at least the XML component
file gets always installed in /usr.

Get an icon for the setup UI
----------------------------

I'd like to work with the GNOME designers on this one, so that we get a icon
that is beautiful and integrates well with GNOME.

Get listed in the GNOME Control Center
--------------------------------------

Modify their whitelist so it uses `cangjie` and `quick` instead of the current
`cangjie3`, `cangjie5`,... from ibus-tables

Get some feedback on the UX
---------------------------

We really need to nail the basic features down with a top-notch UX.

Right now, the implementation is based on the discussions I had, but I know of
many things which might be wrong or missing.

Here's some stuff we could already gather.

    1. [cangjie] Pressing space twice on multiple candidates
    --------------------------------------------------------

    When pressing space, the user sometimes gets multiple candidates.

    When that happens, if the user presses space again, we should commit the
    first candidate.

    2. [cangjie] Input after space on multiple candidates
    -----------------------------------------------------

    When pressing space, the user sometimes gets multiple candidates.

    When that happens, if the user then goes on pressing an input key, we
    shouldn't consider that as the continuation of the previous input.

    Instead, we should commit the first candidate, and start a new input with
    that new key.

    4. Implement full-/half-width support
    -------------------------------------

    Wan Leung recently added `CangJie::getFullWidthChar` to libcangjie, so we
    should use it.

    This needs to respect the user settings.
