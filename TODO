Critical for 1.0
================

Properly document the dependencies in the README
------------------------------------------------

Right now, unless you ask me, you'll have a hard time figuring out what's
needed to install.

Properly check for all dependencies at build-time
-------------------------------------------------

This is similar to the previous one, but on the tooling side, rather than
purely as documentation.

Figure out what's the deal with IBus in /usr/local
--------------------------------------------------

I haven't been able to get IBus to find engines in /usr/local, but I might
just have overlooked the fact that I had to restart IBus after installing
ibus-cangjie...

Try again, ask the IBus devs.

If it works, great. If it doesn't, make sure that at least the XML component
file gets always installed in /usr.

Add a note about building on multilib distros
---------------------------------------------

Not everybody trying to build software from source seems to know about passing
the --libdir=/usr/lib64 (or similar) oarameter to the configure script,
depending on their distro.

The least we can do is add a note about it in the README, or similar
documentation.

Setup the necessary stuff for i18n
----------------------------------

We're a project aiming at helping people to input Chinese. The least we can do
is show all strings in Chinese. ;)

Get an icon for the setup UI
----------------------------

I'd like to work with the GNOME designers on this one, so that we get a icon
that is beautiful and integrates well with GNOME.

Get listed in the GNOME Control Center
--------------------------------------

Modify their whitelist so it uses `cangjie` and `quick` instead of the current
`cangjie3`, `cangjie5`,... from ibus-tables

Get some feedback on the UX
---------------------------

We really need to nail the basic features down with a top-notch UX.

Right now, the implementation is based on the discussions I had, but I know of
many things which might be wrong or missing.

Here's some stuff we could already gather.

    1. [cangjie] Pressing space twice on multiple candidates
    --------------------------------------------------------

    When pressing space, the user sometimes gets multiple candidates.

    When that happens, if the user presses space again, we should commit the
    first candidate.

    2. [cangjie] Input after space on multiple candidates
    -----------------------------------------------------

    When pressing space, the user sometimes gets multiple candidates.

    When that happens, if the user then goes on pressing an input key, we
    shouldn't consider that as the continuation of the previous input.

    Instead, we should commit the first candidate, and start a new input with
    that new key.

Stuff to investigate for future improvements
============================================

Traditional to Simplified Chinese
---------------------------------

At least 2 persons told me that when they want to input Simplified Chinese,
they will usually instead write Traditional Chinese and use some kind of
automatic conversion:

- one person said that Microsoft Word allowed her to do that
- one person said that the Yahoo! KeyKey input method does that too

This is potentially an interesting feature to look into.

Make Cangjie a bit more tolerant to input mistakes
--------------------------------------------------

Cangjie is very unforgiving. If you make a mistake in one of the input
characters, you will only discover it when you hit space, and you have to
start all over again.

It could be possible to be a bit more tolerant and permissive, for example
allowing other results than what the user typed, under certain conditions.

One idea is to return candidates which have input codes that are "close" to
what the user typed. Another factor to add could be the surrounding
characters, or the meaning of the sentence, etc...

This could be done only when no candidates are returned for example, to avoid
giving the user many candidates when he actually typed the right one.

Etc...
