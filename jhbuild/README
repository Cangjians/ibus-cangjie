We want to make ibus-cangjie easier to test.

To make ``ibus-cangjie`` easier to build and test, we provide the necessary
files that help you try it with GNOME's JHBuild.

.. note::

    In order to build all of this, you will need to install a few development
    libraries. Depending on your distributions, the packages might be called
    ``foo-devel`` or ``foo-dev``. On Fedora 18, these are:
    
    * GConf2-devel
    * dconf-devel
    * gtk2-devel
    * gtk3-devel

First, you should install JHBuild. The following commands will install it in
your home directory::

    $ git clone git://git.gnome.org/jhbuild
    $ cd jhbuild
    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ make
    $ make install

In the current folder, you will find a file named ``jhbuildrc``. Simply put
it in the ``~/.config/`` folder.

.. note::

    If you already have a similarly named file in there, make sure to keep a backup!

You might want to quickly check the contents of the ``jhbuildrc`` file, to
adapt it to your needs, but the defaults should just work.

Once this is all in place, you can just run the following::

    $ jhbuild build

This will get the sources for ``ibus-cangjie`` and its dependencies, and build
them all in the right order.

If you're having trouble, just ask us. :)
